              <p class="dog-text">
                The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris)[4] is a member of genus Canis (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids,[5] and is the most widely abundant carnivore.[6][7][8] The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa,[9][10][11] with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[10][11] which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[12] The dog was the first domesticated species[11][13] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[14]

            <h3>Turtle</h3>
            <p class="turtle-text">
              The majority of a sea turtle's body is protected by its shell. The turtle's shell is divided into two sections: carapace (the dorsal portion) and plastron (the ventral portion). The shell is made up of smaller plates called scutes. The leatherback is the only sea turtle that does not have a hard shell. Instead, it bears a mosaic of bony plates beneath its leathery skin.

              In general, sea turtles have a more fusiform body plan than their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts. The reduced volume of a fusiform body means sea turtles can not retract their head, legs, and arms into their shells for protection like other turtles can.[5] However this more stream-line body plan reduces drag in the water and allows the turtle to swim more easily.

              The leatherback is the largest species of sea turtle. Measuring 2–3 meters (6–9 ft) in length, and 1-1.5 m (3–5 ft) in width, weighing up to 700 kilograms (1500 lb). Other species are smaller, being mostly 60–120 cm (2–4 ft) and proportionally narrower.

              <h3>Panda</h3>
              <p class="panda-text">The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, literally "black and white cat-foot"; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo, literally "big bear cat"),[4] also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear[5] native to south central China.[1] It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.[6] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[7][8]</p>
